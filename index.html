<h2>about me</h2>
  <p> Hello,I am currently a student at University Of Nairobi,and my major is
    in Geology with it's emphasis area being Geospatial Information SCience.I
    am currently a student programmer at Moringa School in Nairobi,Kenya.
    I have nil job experience in my fields of study at the moment.
    I decided to learn programming as I thought it would be a useful addition
    to my GIS unit,and also my never ending thirst on software technology and
    development.
    I am currently interested in creative writing and I practice my skills via
    blogging.I enjoy leisure swimming,dessert-tasting and reading novels.I am also
    an amateur guitarist and flute player.
